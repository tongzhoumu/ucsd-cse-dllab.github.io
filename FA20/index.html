        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>
            Deep learning has become a basic method for many application domains of artificial intelligence. While
            teaching materials of deep learning are easily accessible today, it is still tricky to practically apply the
            method after learning the theories. Many skills, such as choosing the correct toolchain, cleaning and
            augmenting training data, diagnosing errors, interpreting learned models, designing ablation experiments,
            have to be trained through extensive practices, better with instructions from experienced researchers.

            This course aims to train students to solve challenging real problems, by working on a single project for
            the whole quarter. Candidate projects are carefully selected open challenges in Computer Vision (e.g., 3D
            segmentation of autonomous driving scenes, http://semantic-kitti.org/). The organization of the course will
            be in the flipped-class format: groups of students will collaborate to work on the project after class; the
            main
            content of the classes would be the discussions between the instructing staff and each group. Resources,
            guidance and feedback will be provided. It is expected that each student will invest above 20 hours per
            week.

        </p>

        <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
        <p>
            Participants have to be master or undergraduate students who have taken deep learning related courses on
            campus, or have previous research experiences in academia/industry labs. The instructor will conduct manual
            screening by checking the background of applicants submitted at this <a

        </p>
